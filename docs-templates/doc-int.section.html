<p>
    When this documentation talks about <span class="arg-type">int</span>, it requires the script to supply the Game's Script API with a natural number.
    The script execution will not fail, but round the number type to an integer if it isn't already.
    Otherwise, the int is an alias for the <a href="proto-number.html">number type</a>.
